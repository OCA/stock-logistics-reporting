Wizard to show discrepancies between stock and accounting valuation, and possibility to make accounting adjustment.

You should use this module if you have products where the inventory valuation is automated (this means that your inventory is connected with accounting). The report allows you to identify the products where the inventory value has a discrepancy with the accounting value for that same product, and to make an adjustment entry in your accounting to align the two values.

In order to use the module, go to Inventory / Reporting / Products with Account Discrepancy, select the date where you are looking to find the discrepancy and run "Show report". Once run, select the entries that you want to adjust and run the action to adjust.
