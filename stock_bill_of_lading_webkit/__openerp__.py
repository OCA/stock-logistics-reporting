    'name': 'Bill of Lading using Webkit Library',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'Reports/Webkit',
    'description': """

A Bill of Lading is a document issued by a carrier to a shipper of goods.
It is a negotiable instrument, and it serves three purposes:
 - it is a receipt for the goods shipped;
 - it evidences the contract of carriage;
 - it serves as a document of title (i.e. ownership).

This document could be different from a Delivery Order as it has some legal
issues.

Two reports are provided in this module
 - Bill of Lading for Delivey Orders;
 - Bill of Lading for Incoming Shipment (the use-case is shipment from an
 international Warehouse
to the local Warehouse).

This module also add a new field for a warehouse to pick form or deliver to;
this field will be used if the default warehouse_id is not set
(normally from a PO).
