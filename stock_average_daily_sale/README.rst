This module allows to gather stock consumptions and build reporting for average daily
sales (aka stock consumptions). Technically, this has been done through a
materialized postgresql view in order to be as fast as possible (some other flow
modules can depend on this).

You can add several configurations depending on the window you want to analyze.
So, you can define criteria to filter data:

* The Warehouse
* The product ABC classification
* The location kind (Zone, Area, Bin)
* The amount of time to look backward (in days or weeks or months or years)

Moreover, you can define:

* A safety factor
* A standard deviation exclusion factor
* A different root location for analysis per Warehouse

Configuration
=============

* To configure data analysis, you should go to Inventory > Configuration > Average daily sales computation parameters

* You need to fill in the following informations:

  * The product ABC classification you want - see product_abc_classification module
  * The concerned Warehouse
  * The stock location kind (Zone, Area, Bin) - see stock_location_zone module
  * The period of time to analyze back (in days/weeks/months/years)
  * A standard deviation exclusion factor
  * A safety factor

* Go to Configuration > Technical > Scheduled Actions > Refresh average daily sales materialized view

  By default, the scheduled action is set to refresh data each 4 hours. You can change
  that depending on your needs.

* By default, the root location where analysis is done is the Warehouse stock location,
  but you can change it.

    * Go to Inventory > Configuration > Warehouses
    * Change the 'Average Daily Sale Root Location' field according your needs

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Move the filter on saturday/sunday to configuration parameters
* An extensible data gathering query
