Valued Picking Report works fine, but when Delivery is installed, there is a conflict between the inheritance introduced by Delivery on stock.report_delivery_document and the one introduced by Valued Picking Report.
As a consequence, when a product has an HS code defined, the report columns are mixed.
This module's fixed this issue.
